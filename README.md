Objective: Refractor the code to add Semantic HTML elements. 

Description: Heriseon's Agency website was not properly built with semantic HTML elements. 
Semantic HTML is important as it makes HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different
sections and layouts of a webpage. This allows important human accessibility tools and browsers 
to better interpret and index content. 

What I Learned: It's not necessary to memorize all eligable semantic elements. Being familiar
and using Google is sufficient. I also increased my familiarity with how CSS and HTML files 
link and work together on a page.
